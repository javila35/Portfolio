        <h1>Styling My Portfolio</h1>

        <p>
            I am in the process of redoing my portfolio. I scrapped my original portfolio that I built with Gatsby in
            favor or building a site from vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. I miss when the internet was a bit simpler.
            Eventually I'd like to end up with a very interactive creative site. For example, some of my favorites are
            <a href="https://goodbrand.studio/" target="_blank">Good.Brand</a>, <a href="https://toyfight.co/"
                target="_blank">Toy Fight</a>, and <a href="https://tommygenesis.com/" target="_blank">Tommy Genesis'
                website</a>.
            <br />
            <br />
            Those websites use some very cool animation and integrate the user's action into the feel of the website.
            Eventually I'd like to be working on projects that incorporate that. I'm especially keen on integrating user
            interaction into the website to create a novel experience. I'd also like to incorporate my personal
            interests into it somehow. The books I read, the shows and movies I watch, the music I listen to it. Just
            throwing ideas out there for myself.
            <br />
            <br />
            As it stands, I am just creating the barebones structure of the website. I'm still not 100% sure what all I
            want to include. But in the interim between having a fully formed website with elements of interaction and
            creativity, I still want this website to be easy to navigate and pleasing to look at.
            <br />
            <br />
            I started out with the typing. I was listening ot a <a href="">SyntaxFM</a> episode where they talk about
            type systems. I had never really thought about a typography CSS file. Because my site doesn't have much
            content, implementing a consistent font style across the site now is easier than it will be down the line.
