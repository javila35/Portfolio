description: "I was a barista up until the day I started working for Collinear. I didn't have stand out projects, and I didn't have experience. How did I manage that?"

I was listening to [this podcast](https://syntax.fm/show/297/hasty-treat-certifications-government-specified-javascript-skills) that talks about a new developers perspective on trying to get a new job. The hosts of the podcasts talked about how certificates weren't as useful as having projects on your resume. 

I agree with that sentiment BUT when I was searching for my first job I didn't have many projects on my resume outside of school projects. I was also working full time, and job searching for another 10-15 hours a week.
